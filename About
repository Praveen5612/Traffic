The code performs a comprehensive analysis of traffic data to understand vehicle patterns at different junctions and evaluate predictive models. Here’s what it reveals:

Data Overview:

The dataset contains traffic data with timestamps, vehicle counts, and junction identifiers.
Key temporal features (year, month, day, hour) are extracted from the timestamps.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Histograms: Show the distribution of vehicle counts at different junctions.
Time Series Plots: Display how vehicle counts change over time at specific junctions.
Heatmap: Illustrates correlations between different data attributes.
Data Standardization:

Vehicle count data is normalized to standard scores (Z-scores) to make the data comparable across different junctions and time periods.
Modeling:

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest models are trained to predict vehicle counts based on features such as temporal attributes.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using R² (how well the model explains the variance) and RMSE (how much the predictions deviate from the actual values).
Lag Features: Adds previous vehicle counts as features to capture temporal dependencies, potentially improving model performance.
Feature Importance:

Identifies which features (e.g., time of day, lagged vehicle counts) are most influential in predicting vehicle counts for each junction.
Overall, the code provides insights into traffic patterns, assesses model performance, and highlights the importance of various features in making accurate predictions.
